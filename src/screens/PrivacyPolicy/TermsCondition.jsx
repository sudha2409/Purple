          Service in detail before registering, accessing or using the Services

          new feature and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in
          connection with the applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in
          addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes

          posting an updated version on this website. The updated version of
          these Terms shall supersede the previous version of the Terms and take
          effect immediately upon posting and may be notified. You have the
          right to opt-out of agreeing to these Terms or any future updated
          version of the Terms, and therefore also using the website, or any of

          Terms of Use. For avoidance of doubt, if any of the provisions becomes
          void or unenforceable, the rest of the provisions of these Terms of
          Use shall be binding upon the User.
