        “Terms”). We strongly urge you to read the Terms of Service in detail
        before registering, accessing or using the Services (defined below).
        Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a
        particular service, activity or promotion or new feature and such
        supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the
        applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be
        deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Services.
        We may amend the Terms at any time by posting an updated version on this
        website. The updated version of these Terms shall supersede the previous
        version of the Terms and take effect immediately upon posting and may be
        notified. You have the right to opt-out of agreeing to these Terms or
        any future updated version of the Terms, and therefore also using the

        For the purpose of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so requires,
        the term “User” shall mean and include any natural or legal person who

        read contemporaneously with the Terms of Use. Illegality or
        unenforceability of one or more provisions of these Terms of Use shall
        not affect the legality and enforceability of the other terms of the
        Terms of Use. For avoidance of doubt, if any of the provisions becomes
        void or unenforceable, the rest of the provisions of these Terms of Use
        shall be binding upon the User.
