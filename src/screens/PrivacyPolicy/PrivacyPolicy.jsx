        <h6>e. How cookies are used for online analytics purposes?</h6>
        <p>
          We may use web analytics services on purplemaze.co, such
          as those of Google Analytics. These services help us analyse how users
          use the services, including by noting the third-party website from
          which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be
          disclosed to or collected directly by such service providers, who use
          the information to evaluate your use of the services. We also use
          Google Analytics for certain purposes related to online marketing, as
          described in the following sections.

          g. What third-party cookies does purplemaze.co use?
        </h6>
        <p>
          Please note that the third parties (advertising networks and providers
          of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use
          cookies on our Services. Also, note that the names of cookies, pixels
          and other technologies may change over time. We use trusted partners
          to help us service advertising, who may place cookies on your device.
          We also pull through content from social networks into our own pages,
          such as embedded Facebook feeds. The social networks, such as
          Facebook, Google, etc. may themselves also put cookies on your
          machine. If a user logs into Facebook, Twitter or Google+ via our
          website, they will leave a cookie on the users' computer. This is the
          same process as if the user logs into these social networks directly.
          We also use Google Analytics on our Services to help us analyse how
          our Services are used. Google Analytics uses performance cookies to
          track customer’s interactions. For example, by using cookies, Google
          can tell us which pages our users view, which are most popular, what
          time of day our websites are visited, whether visitors have been to
          our websites before, what website referred the visitor to our
          websites, and other similar information. All of this information is
          anonymized
        </p>
        <p>
          We suggest that you should check the respective privacy policies for
          these external services to help you understand what data these
          organisations hold about you and how they process it.

        <h6>h. What are Web Beacons?</h6>
        <p>
          purplemaze.co occasionally advertises on third party
          websites. As part of our effort to track the success of our
          advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification
          technology such as "web beacons," or "action tags," which count
          visitors who have come to our site after being exposed to a [insert
          website domain].com banner ad on a third party site. By navigating on
          our site, you agree that we can place cookie and web beacons on your
          computer or device. If you prefer not to receive web beacons, then you
          should stop using our site, or consult your browsing settings.
        </p>
        <h6>i. How to control cookies?</h6>
        <p>
          Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings
          preferences. However, if you choose to turn off these cookies, you
          will still see advertising on the internet but it may not be tailored
          to your interests. It does not mean that you won't be served any
          advertisements whilst you are online. Whilst we have mentioned most of
          the third parties involved in using targeting or advertising cookies
          in the preceding section , the list is not exhaustive and is subject
          to change. Therefore, even if you choose to turn off all the
          third-party cookies listed in section , you may still receive some
          tailored advertisements and recommendations. There are a number of
          ways you can manage what cookies are set on your devices. Essential
          cookies, however, cannot be disabled. If you do not allow certain
          cookies to be installed, the website may not be accessible to you
          and/or the performance, features, or services of the website may be
          compromised. You can also manage this type of cookie in the privacy
          settings on the web browser you are using. Please note that if you use
          your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to
          access parts of our or others' websites. Please see below for more
          information.
